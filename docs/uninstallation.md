# Uninstallation

To uninstall everything, deactivate the virtual environment (with `deactivate`) and just delete the following folders:
    - `<myenv>` (the folder specified above during virtual environment setup)
    - `build` (in the same directory as `setup.py`)
    - `dist` (in the same directory as `setup.py`)
    - `generalization.egg-info` (in the same directory as `setup.py`)
